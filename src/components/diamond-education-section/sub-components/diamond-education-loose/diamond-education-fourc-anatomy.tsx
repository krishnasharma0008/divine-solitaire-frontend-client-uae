                All the diamonds are unique in their own way but share the same
                basic structure. The structural features of a diamond determine
                its brilliance, proportions, and scintillation. Each part of its
                basic structure has a particular name. Understanding how these
                parts contribute to the diamond as a whole help one to choose
                the perfect stone. The basic structure of a diamond consists of
                eight main parts namely table, diameter, crown, girdle,
                pavilion, depth, crown, and culet. Hereâ€™s a brief description of
                each part.

              Diameter: If the width of the polished stone is measured from
              end-to-end, the diameter of the diamond is obtained.

            <p className="mb-1.5 text-justify">
              Table: The table is the largest polished surface on the top of the

            <p className="mb-1.5 text-justify">
              Crown: It is the top part of a diamond that extends from the table

            <p className="mb-1.5 text-justify">
              Girdle: Girdle is the part of the diamond where the crown and
              pavilion of the diamond meet.

            <p className="mb-1.5 text-justify">
