                    Cuts and Shapes :
                    <br />
                    The shape of a diamond refers to the entire geometric
                    proportion of the solitaire whereas cuts are a diamond’s
                    proportions and facets. The cut determines the brilliance
                    and sparkle of solitaire rings. It is the most important
                    factor that helps in deciding the diamond ring price. Not
                    just cost, but it also helps in determining the quality of
                    the stone. Hearts and arrows, round cut, and princess cuts
                    are some of the common choices of cuts. The shape of a
                    diamond is completely a personal choice. Once you have
                    decided the shape and the cut of your solitaire as
                    preferred, the other 3 Cs which are clarity, colour and
                    carat weight become easy to determine. You are also less
                    inclined to change your diamond engagement rings or wedding
                    rings anytime soon as you have chosen the cut and shape
                    yourself and hence, it helps you save cost and stay within
                    your diamond ring budget.

                  1 The 4Cs of Diamond Quality :
                  <br />
                  The 4Cs of diamond are the most important factors while
                  determining the quality of the diamond engagement ring and
                  choosing diamonds as well. The 4C’s of diamond are colour,
                  carat weight, clarity, and cut. The cut refers to the
                  diamond’s proportions and facets and is the most important
                  aspect of a single diamond ring. The cut also determines the
                  brilliance and sparkle of the diamond and helps you choose
                  solitaire of best quality. Colour and clarity refer to the
                  amount of light that gets reflected by the solitaire whereas
                  the carat weight is the weight of pure diamond in the gem. All
                  these factors help you select the diamond solitaire e that you
                  want, the shape and most importantly its cost. Divine
                  Solitaires provides you with diamond engagement rings of
                  premium quality by obtaining the best combination of the 4C’s
                  of diamonds.

                  2 Polish Matters :
                  <br />
                  Polishing the solitaire helps in smoothing the surface of th
                  diamond rings. You can save on your diamond ring price by
                  getting a ‘good’ grade of polishing and not striving for an
                  ‘excellent’ grade as there is not much of a difference between
                  both. Most consumers cannot even distinguish the difference in
                  the quality of polishing.

                  3 Selecting the Metal :
                  <br />
                  Selecting the metal for your diamond ring design is the next
                  important step after the quality of the diamond is decided.
                  The metal is the part on which the diamond is mounted and
                  hence, it is essential as it is required to complement the
                  diamond in order to increase the appeal of the engagement
                  rings The most commonly available metals are platinum, yellow
                  gold, and white gold. Platinum is the most expensive metal as
                  it is durable and has natural luster which does not fade away
                  with time. Platinum rings are also the most preferred as
                  platinum complements the diamonds perfectly well. Yellow gold
                  is a more traditional and classic metal used in engagement
                  rings. Available in two variations; 18K and 14K, the quality
                  of the gold depends on its proportion with alloys. Although it
                  catches scratches easily, the repair costs are lower than that
                  of platinum. White Gold is a combination of gold and other
                  metals which gives it a silver-like colour. The advantage of
                  white gold is that it matches well with your r diamond
                  jewellery set.

                  4 Setting is important too :
                  <br />
                  Ring Settings decides the shape and the way you want your ring
                  to be made and helps you choose solitaire e that will match
                  your engagement ring. There are a variety of options
                  available, standard or custom, that you can choose the setting
                  of your engagement ring from. The setting of engagement rings
                  varies from person to person. The charm of the engagement ring
                  matching the personality of the person wearing it might just
                  increase their appeal and persona. Prong, bezel and tension
                  settings are some of the most used types of settings. However,
                  prongs are the most popular ones as they add brilliance to
                  your solitaire by helping them stand out.
