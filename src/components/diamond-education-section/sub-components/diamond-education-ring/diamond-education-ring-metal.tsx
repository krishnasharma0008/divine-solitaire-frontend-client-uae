                    Everyone is familiar with the traditional yellow gold
                    engagement rings. The most common, yet a very lavish and
                    appealing metal, yellow is the naturally occurring colour of
                    gold and is typically alloyed with silver and copper in fine
                    jewellery. Flexible and enduring, yellow gold is highly used
                    in engagement rings due to its lasting beauty as it does not
                    corrode, tarnish or rust. The higher the karat of the gold,
                    the softer the yellow gold engagement ring is. One can
                    easily identify authentic gold as it carries a ‘k’ or
                    ‘karat’ mark on it. To keep the luster of gold everlasting,
                    the ring should be cleaned with mild soap and warm water.

                    Bearing similarity to platinum diamond engagement rings in
                    its looks, white gold is the most preferred option as the
                    metal for engagement rings. White gold engagement rings are
                    available in two variations; 1) 14K which consists of 55%
                    gold and the rest is composed of other metals (zinc, nickel
                    etc.) and 2) 18K white gold which consists of 75% gold.
                    Cheaper than platinum, white gold is more preferred in
                    engagement rings as it complements the sparkle of solitaire
                    ring designs perfectly. Made with an alloy of nickel and
                    zinc, white gold is coated with rhodium to keep the shine
                    intact. However, radiant white gold requires thorough care
                    to maintain the sparkle of your single diamond ring. The
                    ring should be kept in a cushioned and scratch-proof box. It
                    is also recommended keeping the ring away from harmful
                    corrosives like bleach, ammonia, and chlorine.
