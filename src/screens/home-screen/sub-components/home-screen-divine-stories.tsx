                          husband has given me. I was so surprised that he
                          managed it without letting me know anything at all. I
                          loved the design so much and the diamond is brilliant.
                          He even knew that I had been wanting something like
                          this for a while. I told him how much I loved the
                          ring. This birthday turned out to be such a lovely
                          one.”
