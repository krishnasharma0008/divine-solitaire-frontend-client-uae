                      Divine Solitaires, along with the global diamond industry,
                      has a zero-tolerance policy toward conflict diamonds.
                      Through measures such as the Kimberley Process, which
                      tracks diamonds from mine to market, the industry in
                      partnership with the governments, and non-governmental
                      organizations, policies diamond exports to prevent the
                      trade of illegal diamonds. At Divine Solitaires, we only
                      purchase diamonds through the largest and most respected
                      suppliers who, like us, proudly adhere to and enforce the
                      standards established by the Kimberley Process. All Divine
                      Solitaires diamonds are warranted to be conflict free. If
                      one of our suppliers was ever found to be in violation of
                      that process, we would immediately serve that
                      relationship. We will continue to support and promote any
                      process that works to uphold legitimacy in the diamond
                      trade. Diamonds are mined throughout the world, including
                      major mines in Australia, Africa, Russia and Canada.
                      Diamonds are a major source of good in many African
                      nations, employing and providing healthcare to thousands.
